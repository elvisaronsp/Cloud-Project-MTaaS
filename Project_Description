MTaaS - Mobile Testing as a Service is my cloud project developed in Cloud Technology course in San Jose State University, Fall 2015. 
MTaaS is an application which is a platform for mobile application developers and testers. 
In the current decade, hundreds of mobile applications are been developed and these developers need testers to test the application. 
So my application basically serves as a SaaS running on cloud where developers can upload their application, i.e android or ios, 
testers  can register according to their skills and look for type of project they are interested in and request developer for the particular project.
Developers can also select the testers for their applications.
